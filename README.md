# WellFeast-Food-Inc.-Project
Based on a project I learned in a training (Jonas Schmedtmann), I recoded the project from beginning to end with my own knowledge and made various adjustments on it. During this process, I both practiced to better understand the existing structure and added improvements to the project by adding my own perspective. These studies contributed to the development of both my technical skills and problem-solving skills. While developing this project, I used my HTML and CSS knowledge to the maximum level and learned how to create the front end of a website and make a responsive design.
